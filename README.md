 # KSHFG_Clinic
🚀 Project Overview

This is a Clinic Management System developed as part of our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course project.
The system provides a centralized platform to manage patients, doctors, appointments, and clinic operations, demonstrating practical application of OOP concepts.

🎯 Features
1. Patient Management

Add, update, and view patient details securely.

Track medical history and ongoing treatments.

2. Appointment Scheduling

Book appointments based on doctor availability.

Avoid overlapping appointments for smooth clinic operations.

3. Doctor Profiles

Maintain doctor details, specialties, and schedules.

Assign patients dynamically to doctors.

4. Admin Dashboard

Centralized dashboard to manage users, appointments, and database records.

🌟 Key Highlights

The system is designed using Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles:

Encapsulation: Controlled access to sensitive data.

Inheritance: Efficient reuse of code for entities like patients and doctors.

Polymorphism: Flexible handling of different user types and interactions.

This ensures a modular, maintainable, and scalable system.

💻 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java (backend functionality)

Database: MySQL (patient records, doctor schedules, appointments)

Interface: User-friendly GUI for smooth navigation

📝 Key Learnings

Practical OOP Application: Strengthened understanding of classes, objects, and design patterns.

Problem Solving: Managed overlapping schedules and seamless database integration.

Team Collaboration: Improved communication, code review, and version control practices.
